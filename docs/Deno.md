# Deno

## Notes

- the Deno equivalent of `npm run` is `deno task`
- Deno is pronounces «Dee-no», not «Deh-no»
- Deno requires file endings in imports, which is not supported by the regular TS compiler. This makes sharing code between Deno and a UI framework difficult. It works, as long as the shared files don't have any imports themselves.
